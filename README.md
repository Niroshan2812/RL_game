# 🐍 Snake AI with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements the **classic Snake Game** using **Pygame** and trains an **AI agent** using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** with **PyTorch**.  
The agent learns to play Snake by trial and error, improving over time by maximizing its score.

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

## Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate   

## Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run

python agent.py

The game will run in the background
The AI will start training
Training progress will be shown in a plot

## Training Results

The AI starts with random moves and gradually learns to avoid collisions and eat food.
You’ll see:
Score per game
Mean score trend improving over time
